# Builder.io integrated with Composable Storefront

Welcome to the Builder-integrated PWA Kit project! 

This repository should serve as an example of how to integrate Builder.io's Visual CMS with Salesforce's Composable Storefront / PWAKit platform. There should be little added on top of the base Composable reference storefront, making integration with an existing site quick and easy.

This approach is also compatible without Template Overrides, everything inside overrides folder will match a full exit PWAKit project, but Overrides was chosen to reduce the noise for this example.

Note: This project serves as an integration example, and is not an officially supported project starter.


### Notable Changes
-  Builder space API key stored in the `/config/[site].js` files
-  Patch file to modify approved domain in the iframe allow-list in `commerce-sdk-react`
   -  Necessary due to the MRT preview mode that assumes all iframes are preview mode.
-  `ssr.js` additions to Content Security Policy (CSP) to enable Builder support.
-  Webpack config changes to support importing/requiring CSS files (not required for Builder support).

### Builder Content Areas
-  Page route overrides that include Builder content areas
   -  Homepage
   -  Marketing pages
   -  Blog pages
   -  PLP
   -  PDP
-  Global Header slots
-  Custom Components:

## Getting Started

### Requirements

-   Node 18 or later
-   npm 9 or later
-   [Salesforce Commerce API client](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/setting-up-api-access.html)
-   [A Builder.io account](https://builder.io/signup)

### 

### Run the Project Locally

```bash
npm start
```

This will open a browser and your storefront will be running on http://localhost:3000

Login https://builder.io 

### Important Notes about this Example Implementation

Due to an issue with PWAKit's SDKs, it is necessary to patch the SDK to support running the project in an iframe, which is how Builder's CMS loads the visual preview in the editor. See [this Community PWAKit POC repo](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/composable-storefront-pocs/tree/main) and this thread in the [Unofficial SFCC Slack channel](https://sfcc-unofficial.slack.com/archives/C02KUCHDEKH/p1717452731269259) for more details, the Patch file is attributed to the hard work of others.


### Deploy to Managed Runtime

```
npm run push -- -m "Message to help you recognize this bundle"
```

**Note**: This command will push to the MRT project that matches the name field in `package.json`. To push to a different project, include the `-s` argument.

**Important**: Access to the [Runtime Admin](https://runtime.commercecloud.com/) application is required to deploy bundles. To learn more, read our guide to [Push and Deploy Bundles](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/pushing-and-deploying-bundles.html).

## Customizing the application

This version of the application uses [Template Extensibility](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/template-extensibility.html) to empower you to more easily customize base templates. Please refer to our documentation for more information.

## üåç Localization

See the [Localization README.md](./packages/template-retail-react-app/translations/README.md) for important setup instructions for app localization.

For CMS localization, read Builder's [documentation on localization patterns](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/localization-intro).
